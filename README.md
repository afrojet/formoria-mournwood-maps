## Using the Living Grove

To shift the grove during play:

1. Print the Mournwood cutout map (Formoria_Mournwood_Print_Cutout_Individual_Hexes_Player.pdf).
2. Cut along the dotted hex borders.
3. Swap the positions of any two hexes.
4. Realign interior paths and connections as needed.

Alternatively, Appendix A of the adventure will include pre-built Mournwood map configurations with hexes already shifted, allowing for rapid changes without table disruption.
